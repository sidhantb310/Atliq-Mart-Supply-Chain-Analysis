# Provide Insights to Solve a Supply Chain Issue in the FMCG domain

**Problem Statement**
AtliQ Mart is a growing FMCG manufacturer headquartered in Gujarat, India. It is currently operational in three cities Surat, Ahmedabad and Vadodara. They want to expand to other metros/Tier 1 cities in the next 2 years.

AtliQ Mart is currently facing a problem where a few key customers did not extend their annual contracts due to service issues. It is speculated that some of the essential products were either not delivered on time or not delivered in full over a continued period, which could have resulted in bad customer service. Management wants to fix this issue before expanding to other cities and requested their supply chain analytics team to track the ’On time’ and ‘In Full’ delivery service level for all the customers daily basis so that they can respond swiftly to these issues.

**Objective**
The objective of this project is to measure the service levels of Atliq Mart's supply chain operations using a standardized approach. Specifically, we focused on three key metrics: "On-Time Delivery (%)," "In-Full Delivery (%)," and "On-Time In Full (%)" for customer orders on a daily basis. These metrics were compared against the target service levels established for each customer.

**Business-related terms:**
The comprehensive dashboard provides essential metrics to track and improve AtliQ Mart's service levels. It focuses on key performance indicators such as:

**Order Lines:** Order is a unique request placed by a customer on a given date. Within an order, a customer could request multiple items. Each of these items requested within the order is called an order line.

**On-Time Delivery (OT) % :** This metric measures the percentage of customer orders delivered on time as per the agreed-upon schedule. It is crucial for ensuring customer satisfaction and loyalty.

**In Full Delivery (IF) % :** The IF metric calculates the percentage of orders that were delivered complete, without any missing items. Achieving high IF% is vital in meeting customer demands and avoiding backorders.

**On-Time In Full (OTIF) % :** The OTIF metric combines both on-time delivery and in full delivery to give a holistic view of order fulfillment performance. It indicates how well the company is meeting customer expectations regarding timely and complete deliveries.

**Volume Fill Rate (VFR) % :** VFR measures the percentage of the total order volume that was fulfilled. It helps identify potential issues in supply chain efficiency and inventory management.

**Line Fill Rate (LFR) % :** The LFR metric assesses the percentage of individual product lines in an order that were delivered in full. This allows the company to pinpoint specific products or categories that may be causing delivery issues.
